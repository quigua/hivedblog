If you take another look at the table, you'll see that the sum is much more than 15,000 counts, but the total is 8,967. Players are only counted once at a time, no matter how many battle formats they appear in. The number of players who participated in Season 163 is actually 8,967, according to the battle logs.\nWe currently have approximately 13,700 registered players in our logs since June 3, 2025, which means that about 65% of our active registered players participated in Season 163.\nThanks for stopping by and commenting. By the way, sorry for the initial downvote; my mouse was running out of battery and was doing whatever it wanted.",

For now, it's important that people critically analyze what's wrong so we can correct it and draw reliable conclusions about the game's evolution.

                "body": "Hi there!\n\nI've just completed a thorough review of all the processes running within the service. It looks like it wasn't a bug, but rather an issue with the temporary window for scanning player battles. When I first started developing the service, I set a delay of several seconds between calls to the Splinterlands API to be respectful and avoid overloading the server. Unfortunately, that timing wasn't optimized later on.\n\nAs a result, each player was only being scanned every 24 hours. In many cases, that's just too long, and I believe it caused us to miss some battles. That's probably one of the reasons why our system reported fewer battles than, say, PeakMonsters.\n\nI've already updated those variables, and now each player is scanned approximately every 2 hours. This should prevent battle records from being missed, making the data much more accurate and reliable. Before this change, I was only able to get 2 of your battles, but after the update, the results were much closer to reality:\n\n-------\n\n-- SPS Earnings Report for seattlea (Season 164, Wild Format) ---\nTotal SPS Earned: 103.6200\nSPS Earned per Day:\n  2025-08-01: 13.7940\n  2025-08-03: 89.8260\n\n--- Debug Summary for seattlea (Season 164, Wild Format) ---\nTotal player battles processed (including losses): 48\n  - Ignored due to null JSON: 0\n  - Ignored due to JSON parsing error: 0\n  - Ignored due to 0 SPS (even if won): 0\n------\n\n\nIt's likely that between August 1st and 3rd, many battles weren't recorded. However, this should now be resolved. While the data has always been precise, it wasn't exact, and with this modification, it should start to be. Unfortunately, there's no other way to verify this than by waiting a few days to see how the data evolves.\n\nThank you so much for your support, and we're always here to help. Cheers!",

        "body": "Hi @unitmaster. Nice to greet you. Yes, I was also surprised to see so many active accounts, but after thinking about it carefully, I realized that doesn't correspond to the actual number of players, because some players have multiple accounts. To know how many players there really are in Splinterlands, we'd need to identify which accounts belong to the same player, and that's not so easy to determine, though I don't think it's impossible. At least now we know how many accounts are being played, which is a step in that direction. Regards and thank you very much for your comment.",
