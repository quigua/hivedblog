Have you tried to rent any of the powerful monsters or summoners lately? If so, you must have realized that most of the cards are locked from fighting ranked battles for the next 30 to 47 hours.

<center>Of the 47 Yodin Zaku for rent only 7 were available to fight immediately </center>

The reason for this restriction is that the card was recently transferred from one user account to another. And this is happening more and more frequently, until in a very short time it will be the norm in the card rental system.

## Why is this happening more often?


This new dynamic has its origin in the elimination of the CP as a requirement to level up in the leagues. Since there are no penalties for not having cards to play in a certain league, players can transfer all their cards to a new account after they have consumed their quota of 50 battles. The only restriction is that they must wait up to 48 hours before they can use the cards on the new account. 

## The risk of being scammed

But we know that greed has no shame, so many players choose to rent their cards during this cooldown period, hoping that someone clueless will rent the card and be surprised that they can't fight with that card. I even dare to predict that most rentals will be canceled before the cards can be used in battle, generating financial losses to whoever dares to rent one of those cards. You pay but you won't be able to use it.

## Possible solutions to this budding scam

To my knowledge, there are two possible solutions to this budding scam. The first is a quick patch fix that prevents renting cards that are in this cooldown period. Cards that have been transferred cannot be rented during that recovery period.

The second solution is much more serious, and would be thinking about the long-term future. It consists of returning the true economic value to the cards that were pulverized with a stroke of the pen for no apparent reason by eliminating the CP requirement to be able to move up or stay in a league. The players invested huge amounts of money and time to accumulate these assets, and from one day to the next they were devalued, eroding not only the economic value of the game but also eroding the most precious asset of all, which is trust in the game. Why should I buy land or other in-game assets if experience tells me that all of it is going to be intentionally devalued in the future?

All of this leads me to the next question.

## Why remove the CP requirement for leagues?

Something I still haven't quite figured out is why remove the CP requirement to move up in the leagues?

Of course, the staked SPS requirement should have been added as stated in the whitepaper. But what didn't make sense to me was removing the real and traded values ​​in the game such as cards, to be replaced exclusively by SPS which are utilitarian and have no real effect on the dynamics of the game itself.

Maintaining the CP requirement to be able to move up the leagues resolves most of the issues that are and will undoubtedly be generated, such as:


- Bots cannot rank up unless they invest in cards or rent cards. Reactivating the rental market
- Avoid the proliferation of multiple accounts because it is required to invest in SPS, cards or rentals to be able to maintain them
- Reduce SPS farming from multiple accounts



For those few people who are really interested in the future of this game: Do you think it's a good idea to reimplement the CP requirement to be able to climb the leagues?
