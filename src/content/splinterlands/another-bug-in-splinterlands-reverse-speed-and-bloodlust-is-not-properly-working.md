Bloodlust is one of the most powerful abilities in Splinterlands units, because the monster becomes more dangerous every time it defeats an enemy, gaining +1 to all stats, except for the reverse speed rule where speed must decrease by instead of increasing.

But this ability is not working properly right now in the battle with the reverse speed rulset.  In this case the speed of the monster with bloodlust abiltiy increase every time you defeat a monster, instead of decreasing, making your unit weaker as the battle go on. 

This can be seen in the following battle:

Maybe, correcting this bug will help me to increase my win ratio against bots... 

Just to call your attention to this possible bug I mention you @aggroed and @yabapmatt. I do not use Discord.
