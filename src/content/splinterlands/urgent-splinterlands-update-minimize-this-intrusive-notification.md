Hello friends! Splinterlands has had many updates in recent weeks, changes that have undoubtedly impacted the way we play, win, and appreciate this great game. From my perspective, almost 100% of the changes have been positive, and have managed to change my perception of the game, which is generally somewhat pessimistic, with a clear aversion to investing.

Among the latest changes is the revamp of the user interface and notifications, which in general I find pleasant, although the dark tones in combination with very small letters tend to tire my eyes quickly, so I have noticed that I tend to to play much less.


![Captura desde 20240418 111251.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmYYgBumoYqjYuoc1BhTZXox1MngrbTVm35Bpza6ahbFtZ/Captura%20desde%202024-04-18%2011-12-51.png)

But something that has definitely been bothering me a lot is the notification about the status of the brawls. This notification appears insistently every time you go to battle and after finishing each battle. Each time you have to click on the notification to make it disappear and use the "Battle" button.

The problem is that the notification completely hinders the "battle" button and reappears all the time after each battle, as shown in the image.

I decided to make this post, because I realized that this notification bothers me much more than losing ten battles in a row.

I know that in the settings it is possible to choose not to show any type of notifications about brawls, but I want to be notified when a new brawl is starting, because otherwise I lose the opportunity to participate because I simply forget. What I don't want, nor need, is that notification appear hundreds of times, and again after each battle.

Perhaps a simple and elegant option would be a simple "Don't show me this notification anymore" that blocks it from showing for several hours. Notifications should be reminders and not harassing.

I know that soon there will be some type of improvement or change to this notification because the way it currently works is simply absurd, but I would be very happy if it were a priority, even if it could be considered something of little importance.

Ready. I had to say it!

Greets and a hug.
