A month ago, I read a post by @seattlea titled [How Many Splinterlands Players Are In Modern League Right Now?](https://hive.blog/hive-13323/@seattlea/how-many-splinterlands-players-are) that caught my attention for several reasons. Firstly, I loved the way the author analyzed the available data to try and deduce the number of active Splinterlands players in the modern format. Secondly, I was surprised that after so many years, it's still so difficult to answer such basic and important questions for analyzing and tracking the health of Splinterlands.

At that time, after reading the article, I dedicated myself to searching for various available statistical sources on Splinterlands. Although I found several interesting sources such as [Splintercards](https://www.splintercards.com/) by @tehox, [SplinterStats](https://splinterstats.net/) by @kiokizz, or the [Splinterlands statistics tool](https://github.com/gamerbeaker007/splinterlands-stats) by @beaker007, it turns out that all these tools are more focused on player assets than on the social or community aspect of the game as a whole. Thus, inspired by @seattlea's post, I decided to sit down and work on setting up a system for collecting Splinterlands battle information.

I set up my infrastructure for information storage a couple of days after the start of Splinterlands Season 162. In the future, if I see that it's of interest to players, I will publish a post with the details of this infrastructure. Due to the design of the Splinterlands API, to obtain battles from all active players, it's necessary to create a kind of crawler that iterates over each player's battle history. This is a very effective strategy that allows for initially identifying players who are truly active in Splinterlands. The problem is that to get all the data, the server has to be collecting information permanently.

Today, while performing routine maintenance on my servers, I remembered that I was collecting this Splinterlands information. Well, what really happened is that I encountered a warning message that one of my SSDs was almost full, and after checking, I realized it was related to the data I was collecting from Splinterlands. The data is growing at a rate of approximately 1 GB of information per day, so if I want to maintain this data permanently, I'm going to need to acquire an SSD to use exclusively for Splinterlands.

Now let's try to see the payoff...

## How many active battle players does Splinterlands currently have?

Splinterlands currently has **12,505 active players** between June 3rd and July 25th, 2025. This is the type of question that catches my attention and for which I have always wanted to have an answer. Well, now I have that possibility, and I'm thinking of creating an entire service around battle-related questions that can be key to understanding the health of Splinterlands at any given moment. Without further ado, here are some questions and answers in graphical format.

## How many battles per day take place in Splinterlands?


![all_battles_per_day.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmbHXVtgJmUvCtDGXQ3gaZkTHBiNWThprtAxYK1L6hSHRX/all_battles_per_day.png)

This graph shows all the battles that have been registered since I started crawling players. Even though registration began on July 2nd, 2025, there were battles in players' histories dating back to June 3rd, 2025. The data before July 2nd is incomplete, which is why fewer battles are observed, but from that date onward it should be precise and accurate. The last point corresponds to today, which has not yet been completed. This data tells me that there are around 15,000 battles per day in Splinterlands, which contrasts significantly with the 50,000 battles reported by [Peakmonster on its dashboard](https://peakmonsters.com/dashboard).

## How many unique players per league per day in season 162?

GRAPH OF PLAYERS IN MODERN PER LEAGUE PER DAY

GRAPH OF PLAYERS IN WILD PER LEAGUE PER DAY

These are the graphs I like the most, and they are surely the ones that provide the most scope for analysis, speculation, and deductions about the health of Splinterlands. Go!

## What time is Splinterlands played the most?

I always wanted to know what time Splinterlands had the most players, because I thought it should depend on each continent. Well, it's quite homogeneous, even though more detailed analyses are needed to extract accurate information.

GRAPH OF NUMBER OF BATTLES IN ALL FORMATS
![battles_per_hour_season_162.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmbcvvZZh7L8u3YLai67LipCbtdfsZP6AA4waAQMpysucC/battles_per_hour_season_162.png)


This graph shows that the distribution is quite homogeneous throughout the day, however it is noticeable that between 9 pm and midnight in New York (10 am to 1 pm in Tokyo and 3 am to 6 am in Berlin) is when the greatest number of battles occur in Splinterlands.

GRAPH OF NUMBER OF BATTLES PER HOUR FOR MODERN FORMAT
![battles_per_hour_season_162_modern.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmbjW3oyo49TZYQpW8bobmcu1Ke6X9YLBhBcpcRocDiX4Z/battles_per_hour_season_162_modern.png)

GRAPH OF NUMBER OF BATTLES FOR WILD FORMAT

## What has my activity been like in Splinterlands?
Here is my battle log. Since the last UI changes in Splinterlands, my interest in battling has been gradually declining, almost to nullity, as can be seen in this data.

QUIQUA'S BATTLES
![quigua_battles_per_day.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmSbGoRp2tSPbFmf6uoEwiUok4jYMDxNYWxzVLxc2reazS/quigua_battles_per_day.png)

And finally, the reason for this article:

## How many players did Splinterlands have in Season 162?

Here is the graph of unique players distributed per day. This graph includes all players in modern, wild, survival, tournaments, and brawls formats.

GRAPH OF UNIQUE PLAYERS PER DAY
![players_per_day_season_162_average.png](https://images.hive.blog/DQmT6ifqRdkMFGzmefN3LVh7pijjTLmNGbaMPtmeWt4Abje/players_per_day_season_162_average.png)

In a very brief analysis, we can say that on average about 3,000 players battle constantly in Splinterlands, and that amount doubles every 5 or 6 days when we have brawls. This represents about 25% of all active players battling daily in Splinterlands. For brawls, another approximately 3,000 players join, which represents another 25% of the total players. In the best case, only 50% of active players participate in battles at the same time, well, actually, on the same day. And this makes a lot of sense to me, because if all players follow more or less the same battle strategy that I followed, then they only battle every two days to use the 50 accumulated energies. Therefore, under this strategy, we should only find on average a maximum of half of the active players on any given battle day.

And the answer to the question, **"How many players did Splinterlands have in Season 162?"** The answer is:


----

**Unique Players for Season 162**

----

*Modern*: **3366**
*Wild*: **1966**
*Survival*: **959**
*Tournaments*: **6838**

*Total Unique Players*: **8621**

----

It is truly very satisfying for me, and it brings me great pleasure to be able to obtain numbers that answer important and specific questions.

## Conclusion

I have implemented an infrastructure for constant and continuous monitoring of battles in Splinterlands. In this post, I have tried to show which relevant questions in Splinterlands can be easily answered through graphs and analysis of battle data. I hope that this type of information will allow for evaluating and determining the impact of changes in Splinterlands on player dynamics, as well as assessing the evolution and progress of the Splinterlands ecosystem over time.

## Disclaimer and Data Accuracy for this Post

I have written this post quickly to show interesting results from the accumulated data and what can be achieved with the analysis of that data. However, you should keep in mind that all the scripts for processing this data were done hastily, and I spent very little time obtaining results in graphs. This means that none of the scripts have been validated or reviewed with the rigor required for a production project. This means they may have unintentional errors in their code. I am currently developing a quite complex personal project on Hive (Hived Blogs) that is consuming all my time, but even so, I want to create an information service with this data for Splinterlands players. For this, I plan to dedicate at least 4 hours per week to the development of this service.

It goes without saying that the implementation of this service has the sole objective of addressing the concerns and prerogatives of Splinterlands users. This means that I hope you will let me know what your key concerns and questions are that you believe should be answered and evaluated permanently to have a clear overview of the development of the Splinterlands ecosystem.

Thank you very much for your support, and I look forward to hearing your suggestions...
