The parameter I use most often to measure progress in Splinterlands is my collection power (CP). Until recently, the only place on the Splinterlands website where you could indirectly check the actual value of CP was on the SPS airdrop page. The airdrop page showed how much your actual CP contributed to the points for the airdrop, and that way you could see how much CP you had at 12 noon each day. But now that page has been changed and there is no way to know your true CP unless you look at it on the "cards" page, as long as you don't have rented, sold or delegated cards.

Of course, on the "Cards" page you have access to a CP value at the top as shown in the figure. But, that value is not your actual CP but the consolidated value after adding and subtracting all the cards that are being rented, put up for sale or delegated. So if you frequently rent, delegate or sell your cards, there is no way to know how much CP you have right now.

The request I make is very simple, that the CP displayed on the card page reflect the actual value of a player's CP. If I choose, for example, the "owned" filter, it should show the CP of all the cards that are owned by me. If I choose the filter "rented to me" it should show only the CP of the cards that I have rented, and so on with each of the available filters. I have the impression that it is not a very complicated script and that it would save a lot of time for players like me, who use the calculator too often adding and subtracting CP to obtain information that is basic and should be present on the game page permanently .

Maybe I'm wrong and for most players it's not important to be able to know the CP breakdown information, but for me it's interesting to know, for example, how much CP do I have in each of the splinters? That would be great, if I could just click on the "death" splinter, choose the "owned" filter, and voila! I know how much CP I have from that splinter. One of my basic strategies is to try to grow the splinters in a balanced way, but the problem is that I can't even quickly tell how much CP I have in each of those splinters, unless I grab the calculator, and after several hundred clicks to go to each of the pages of the cards to know the value of their CP, add them one by one.

There is probably some third party tool out there that is providing this kind of broken down information, but for new players who are usually only familiar with the splinterlands website, or for players like me who hate having to search for basic game information on other sites, It is essential that this type of information, which is so important for the growth and development of the players' strategy, is present and accessible on the game's website.

Well, for now that's all I wanted to ask of you. Now, I have to go back to the calculator to finish breaking down my CP, and I estimate that's going to take another couple of hours.

What do the other players think of the request? Don't you miss a real CP monitor?

Greetings to all and I hope to battle with you in [Splinterlands](https://splinterlands.com?ref=quigua)!
