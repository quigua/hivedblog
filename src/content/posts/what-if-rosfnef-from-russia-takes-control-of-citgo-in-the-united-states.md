Today I read the **Reuter** news that: [Russias's Rosneft says has Citgo stake as collateral in Venezuela's PDVSA deal](http://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFR4N1IH03D).

In the current conditions that Venezuela is experiencing, in which we are plunged in a strong economic recession, with high levels of hyperinflation, with international reserves reaching historical lows, with a PDVSA that according to connoisseurs does not reach 50% of the production of 20 years ago, and to top it off, with a price of a barrel of oil well below the needs of the country; **What are the chances that Rosneft will not take control of Citgo?**

And for me the most important question is, if this were to happen, what would be the consequences of this?

I do not know the current situation in the United States, and I do not know if Russia owns or has any kind of control over some energy companies on American soil. That is why I would like to know what you think, in the hypothetical case of Rosneft taking control of Citgo, and whether this represents a major problem for the United States.
Please, I need you to illustrate me.
